# array_addition
**Write a programme that solves the following:**

Given an array 
eg: [33, 6, 9, 1, 23, 88, 2]

Split the array in 2
[33, 6, 9, 1, 23, 88, 2] => [33, 6, 9], [1, 23, 88, 2]

then add 1st array with the 2nd array
eg
       [33, 6, 9]
[1, 23, 88, 2]

gives => [1, 56, 94 ,11]

keep doing this till you end up with just one number

**Example:**
`[1, 56, 94 ,11] => [1, 56], [94, 11] => [95, 67]
[95, 67] => [95], [67] => 162`

## How to run the code?
Once you have cloned or downloaded the code, navigate to `~/array_addition/` & run `python array_addition.py`
